# WindCompas
CustomView control, simulating wind compas
CustomView, draws circle with four sides of the world (North, East, South and West) and pointer pointing to the North. 
This is just a show case for purpose of the udacity sunshine android course.
Some methods are commented, but code can be imported and used in Sunshine application to create custom view and to pass wind 
direction and angle. CompassView will use direction information to highlight (paint in red) current world side and angle to point the
line.
